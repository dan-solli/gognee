Post-release note: Update `released_by` in this doc to the authorizing user. This file reflects the successful release execution on 2026-02-19.

## Post-release verification

- Not applicable — release did not execute due to workspace state.

## Issues encountered

- Uncommitted / unstaged changes present in the working tree. Per release policy, all plan changes must be committed locally before tagging and pushing. Please commit (or stash) and re-run the release.
- CHANGELOG date mismatch: entry shows 2026-02-18 while release executed on 2026-02-19. Confirm desired date and update `CHANGELOG.md` if necessary.

## Recommended next steps

1. Review the uncommitted changes listed above and either:
   - Stage & commit them locally with a message referencing Plan 023 and target release v1.6.0, or
   - Move unrelated work to a feature branch and leave release commits on `main` only.

2. After commit(s), re-run this release procedure. The commands to create and push the tag are:

```bash
git tag -a v1.6.0 -m "Release v1.6.0 - Memory Decay Structured Logging (Plan 023)"
git push origin v1.6.0
```

3. Verify remote tag presence:

```bash
git ls-remote --tags origin refs/tags/v1.6.0
```

4. Confirm `agent-output/deployment/v1.6.0.md` triggered by this run and update `released_by` to the authorizing user when the push succeeds.

## Audit trail

- Release invocation: user request on 2026-02-19
