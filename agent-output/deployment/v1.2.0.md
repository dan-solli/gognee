# Release v1.2.0 — gognee

**Release Version:** v1.2.0
**Date (staged):** 2026-01-15
**Included Plans:**
- Plan 017 — Always-On Observability (shared with glowbabe)
- Plan 018 — Vector Search Optimization (sqlite-vec)

## Summary
- Consolidates metrics and trace implementations so they are always compiled in. `NewFileExporter("")` is a runtime no-op; metrics registry is available for gatherers. Default metrics endpoint for consuming backends: 127.0.0.1:8890.

## Pre-Release Verification
- UAT: Plan 017 approved.
- UAT: Plan 018 approved (vector search optimization, performance validated)
- Unit tests: all packages executed; `pkg/store` tests validated with CGO_ENABLED=1
- Benchmarks: `BenchmarkVectorSearch_1000Nodes` → ~111 µs/op (documented in QA)

## Files Changed (high level)
- `pkg/metrics/*` — removed build tags; tests updated
- `pkg/trace/*` — file exporter consolidated; noop behavior retained at runtime
